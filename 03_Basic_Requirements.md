= Basic installation requirements
In this chapter we will start with the basic requirements to start installing OpenConext. Later on in the how-to there will be a couple of extra requirements installed, but I keep them there so that it is abvious they server that particular part of the installation.

== Become root
$ sudo su -

== Apache
