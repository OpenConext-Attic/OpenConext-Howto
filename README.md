# OpenConext-Howto
OpenConext is developed on CentOS 6, soon 7 and the easy install requires a compatible setup on the target server. This manual however explores the journey of installing all the required parts on a fresh Ubuntu Xenial 16.04 LTS server. The purpose of the excercise being two-fold: help those unwilling or unable to fullfil the CentOS requirements and provide a thorough understanding of the actions "magically" done by the Ansible installation by executing them step-by-step, by hand.

Bear in mind that a normal OpenConext installation heavily relies on it's own technology for authentication. Which means all management interface are protected bu SAML logins. For the sake of simplicity and speed I skipped this part of the configuration sometimes in order to have a working proof of concept without needing to create trivial authentication scenario's. Given the examples in this documentation it shouldn't be too difficult to switch to SAML login after initial setup.
